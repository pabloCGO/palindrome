# palindrome

## Please describe time and space complexity of your algorithm:

To solve this challenge I thought to form substrings using two "for", first one by one (one letter).. two by two until the maximum length of the chain,
I think my code is easy to understand.
It was a interesting challenge. I spend around 1 hour and I include tests and the project has a basic structure in Spring boot.
